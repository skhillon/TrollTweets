    "Recently, evidence has been mounting that Russia influenced the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, primarily by creating social media buzz to polarize voters against the other side. Social media feeds further reinforce this echo chamber by serving content that users would like (see [Blue Feed, Red Feed](http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/) from the Wall Street Journal). Social media giants have begun flagging content from questionable sources in an effort to combat this effect. In December 2016, Facebook [began flagging fake news](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/12/news-feed-fyi-addressing-hoaxes-and-fake-news/) but [stopped in December 2017](https://medium.com/facebook-design/designing-against-misinformation-e5846b3aa1e2) due to a variety of reasons, one being that it [may backfire and further reinforce biased opinions](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100612451018). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, content shared on Twitter is different as it is less of a series of links and more of a series of user opinions. An exclusive article from NBC revealed a data set of over 200,000 tweets from over 400 accounts marked as Russian trolls. **The aim of this project is to create an algorithm that identifies accounts as Russian trolls.**"
